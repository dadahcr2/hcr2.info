#### Rewards earned from the various chests

The numbers shown in the game are often minimums and may understate actual rewards.  Based on collected data, estimates of the **average rewards (and range)** of coins, parts, and gems from the various chests are as follows:

\* Please note that experience will vary based on number of customizations already owned as coins are increased for duplicate customizations  as follows: 1000 coins for a Common Customization, 2000 coins for Rare, 3000 coins for Epic, and 4000 coins for Legendary.

These numbers may be updated as more data is collected.  The underlying data is available [here](.\chestdata)

#### Order of cup chests

**Cup chests** have a specific sequence:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/617353655468687390/723882517739864084/image0.png)

This is made up of 87 Common(3h), 3 Uncommon(6h), 18 Rare(8h), 2 Epic(12h) and 1 Champion(24h) Chest

####  Adventure Chests

The gems, coins, and parts vary based on the level of the chest. The level of the chest depends in the distance travelled. For normal maps, Level 1 Is reached at 500m, and increases by 1 for every additional 500m.  For the hard maps (Intense City, Forest Trials, and Raging Winter), Level 1 is reached at 100m and increases by 1 for every additional 100m.

***Gems:*** One gem is earned at Level 1, a second at Level 4, and an additional one every fourth level thereafter; however, for the hard maps, the second gem is earned at Level 5, and an additional one every fifth level thereafter.  Total gems are capped at 8 per run.

***Coins:*** Coins earned are 1000 + 400 coins for every level.  The first chest level is achieved by reaching 500m, and the level goes up every 500m thereafter; however, for the hard maps, levels are incremented every 100m and coins increase by 200 for each level.
Additional coins are earned if a duplicated paint/skin would have been awarded (common=1000 coins, rare=2000 coins).

***Parts:*** Parts awarded from adventure chests are variable but step up at certain levels with parts similar to that of the following chests:	

Level | Chest
:--: | :--
 1-6 |	**Common** (at least 18 common and 2 rare parts)
 7-12 | **Uncommon** (at least 29 common 2 rare parts)
 13+ |	**Rare** (at least 45 common and 6 rare parts)

The parts awarded differ for the hard maps (Intense City, Forest Trials, and Raging Winter):

Level | Chest
:--: | :--
 1-5 | **Common** (at least 18 common and 2 rare parts)
 6+ | **Uncommon** (at least 29 common 2 rare parts)

This can be seen in the the below charts which represent data on common and rare parts awarded from adventure chests:

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/806343355264401478/821413177945882696/unknown.png) 

Accordingly, from a parts perspective, it appears best to at least reach 6500m (Level 13 chest), except for the three hard maps, where there is no improvement in parts beyond 600m i.e. Level 6.

#### Weekly Team Chest

Rewards vary depending on the level of the chest at the end of the week. Teams start the week at Level 1 and need to travel 65km in total to reach Level 2.  The distance required increases by 30km for each additional level e.g. 95km to go from Level 2 to Level 3, 125km to go from Level 3 to Level 4, etc.
 
***Gems:*** Gems awarded start at 7 for Level 1 and increase by 2 for each level until they hit the cap of 50 (Level 23+).

***Coins:*** Coins start at 24000 for Level 1 and increase by 4000 for each level until they hit the cap of 200000 (Level 45+).

***Parts:*** Parts awarded are random but do step up at specific levels.  Parts awarded are similar to the following chests:

Level | Chest
:--: | :--
1-2 | **Common** (at least 18 common and 2 rare part)
3-5 | **Uncommon** (at least 29 common and 2 rare parts)
6-9 | **Rare** (at least 45 common and 6 rare parts)
10-13 | **Epic** (at least 68 common, 9 rare and 6 epic parts)
14-17 | **Champion** (at least 113 common and 12 epic parts)
18+ | **Legendary** (at least 113 common, 12 epic and 3 legendary parts)

Accordingly, there is a strong incentive to reach Level 18 in order to secure legendary parts for all team members
